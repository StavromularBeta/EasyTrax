    &#34;&#34;&#34;Parses text files generated by the DOS program FirstChoice, prepares data for conversion to WTX format.

    Final reports can be generated by the current MB Labs LIMS system in text format.

    These files contain data displayed vertically (analytes going down the page, samples across), and horizontally
    (analytes going across the page, samples going down). Both data types can be handled together or independently.

    sample metadata is not present in vertically displayed files, so backup sample metadata is gathered from the
    report headers.

    This file parses reports, extracts sample metadata and data from report headers and data tables, and combines
    them all together in one universal data format that is handled by EasyTraxConvert.

    Last Updated: 09June2021, P.L.

    Attributes
    ----------
    job_number : str
        the job number of the report being converted.

    mb_file : list(str)
        the contents of the text file being converted, line by line, in a list.

    mb_file_split_lines : list(list(str))
        each line split based on spaces (ex. [&#39;hello          world I           am&#39;,] -&gt; [[&#39;hello&#39;,&#39;world&#39;,&#39;I&#39;,&#39;am&#39;],]

    sample_list_indexes : list(int)
        the indexes of each sub list in fc_file_split_lines that have the string &#39;SAMPLE&#39; at the beginning of the list.
        these are the start points of the horizontal data tables.

    analyte_list_indexes : list(int)
        the indexes of each sub list in fc_file_split_lines that have the string &#39;ELEMENTS&#39; at the beginning of the
        list. These are the start points of the vertical data tables.

    backup_sample_list_indexes : list(int)
        the indexes of each sub list in fc_file_split_lines that have the string &#39;Samples:&#39; at the beginning of the
        list. These are the start points of the header sample metadata.

        the individual samples in the header sample metadata, in a list of lists.

    job_dictionary : dict{}
        contains information pertaining to the overall job, like the job number.

    samples_dictionary : dict{}
        contains information pertaining to the samples. Format in this dict is:
        key: sample name (str)
        value: sample locator code, date, time, list of lists (each sub list is a triplet, [analyte, unit, value])

    metal_triplets_dictionary : dict{}
        contains information pertaining to the vertically formatted (analytes down, samples across) samples.
        Temporarily stored in this dictionary, then added to the samples_dictionary. Format:

        value: list of data triplets [[analyte, unit, value],[analyte, unit, value],...]

    Methods
    -------
    * `easy_trax_parse_controller()` -
        executes the various methods/functions in the script in the right order.

    * `split_lines_by_spacing()` -
        converts each line in self.fc_file into a list, split by spaces.

    * `get_client_name_and_jobnumber()` -
        gets the client name and the job number from the first line of the text file. Jobnumber is also passed to class
        as a parameter (forgot, wrote this unnecessary bit of code, too lazy to delete).

        * `get_job_number_from_first_line(list_to_check)` -
            finds the job number in the first line.

    * `look_for_anchor_indexes_in_split_lines()` -
        looks for the string &#39;SAMPLE&#39; in the list of lines, adds those indices to self.sample_list_indices.
        looks for the string &#39;Samples:&#39; in the list of lines, adds those indices to self.backup_sample_list_indices.
        looks for the string &#39;ELEMENTS&#39; in the list of lines, adds those indices to self.analyte_list_indexes.

    * `pre_generate_backup_samples_dictionary_entries()` -
        if there are any indexes in self.backup_sample_list_indexes, then this method will take them and parse
        the sample header metadata into trimmed lists, consisting of [sample id, name1, ... namex, code, date, time]

    * `use_sample_indexes_to_get_sample_data()` -
        iterates through the indexes in sample_list_indexes, and uses them to fill samples_dictionary with data.

        * `get_analye_information(item)` -
            access the line above the sample index passed, which has the analyte information. Occasionally there
            is a 0 at the start of this line (for whatever reason). If this 0 is found, it&#39;s removed.

        * `get_units_information(item)` -
            accesses the line corresponding to the sample index passed. This line has the unit information. Removes
            the first three items in the line, which are the strings &#39;SAMPLE&#39;, &#39;DATE&#39;, and &#39;TIME&#39;.

        * `get_samples_data(item)` -
            starts at the line at index + 2. This is the first sample line. Grabs each sample line until the sample
            name is &#34;Lab Blank&#34; (note, this wouldn&#39;t work if &#34;Lab Blank&#34; wasn&#39;t the last sample in the data table,
            and may need to be changed in the future for large jobs that might not necessarily have &#34;Lab Blank&#34; as the
            last sample for a given data table).

        * `split_samples_into_name_and_information(samples, analyte_information)` -
            takes list of samples created by get_samples_data, and, using the analyte_information, splits the sample
            lines into the two lists - one has the name, date, and time for the sample, and the other list has analyte
            values.

        * `generate_samples_dictionary_entries(samples_binary_list)` -
            goes through the various sample names in the samples_binary_list and uses them to make keys in the
            samples_dictionary.

        * `generate_data_triplets(analyte_information, units, samples_binary_list)` -
            matches analye names, units, and values for each analyte, for each sample, and adds data triplets to
            the samples_dictionary under the correct sample name.

    * `generate_backup_samples_dictionary_entries()` -
        takes the lists generated by pre_generate_backup_samples_dictionary_entries and converts them into appropriate
        key: value pairs in samples_dictionary, if the sample is not already in there.

    * `use_analyte_indexes_to_get_sample_data()`
        iterates through the indexes in analyte_list_indexes, and uses them to fill metal_triplets_dictionary with data.

    * `combine_metal_triplet_dictionary_with_samples_dictionary()`
        matches the sample ID keys in metal_triplets_dictionary to sample ID + name keys in samples_dictionary. Once
        matched, adds data in metal_triplets_dictionary to samples_dictionary.

        Is called in EasyTraxTK. Returns the samples_dictionary and job_dictionary to EasyTraxTK
        for passing to the converter.

        Returns

    def split_lines_by_spacing(self):
        &#34;&#34;&#34; converts each line in self.mb_file into a list, split by spaces.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        for item in self.mb_file:
            self.mb_file_split_lines.append(item.split())

    def get_client_name_and_jobnumber(self):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;gets the client name and the job number from the first line of the text file.

        Jobnumber is also passed to class as a parameter
        (forgot, wrote this unnecessary bit of code, too lazy to delete). &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # if you leave a blank line before the start of the header, will need to access self.fc_file_split_lines[1][0:2]
        # otherwise, you want to access the first line.

    def get_job_number_from_first_line(self, list_to_check):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;finds the job number in the first line.

        checks to see if there is a &#39;pg X&#39; after the job number. Checks by seeing if the length of the last element is
        7. If it is, it&#39;s assumed to be the job number. If it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s assumed to be the &#39;pg X&#39; designator, and it
        is also assumed that the list element before it is the job number.

        Parameters
        ----------
        list_to_check : list
            the list to check - the first line of the file, split by space, in list form.

        Returns
        -------
        list_to_check[n] : string
            where n = -1 or -2. The item at index n will be the jobnumber in string form. &#34;&#34;&#34;

        if len(list_to_check[-1]) == 7:
            return list_to_check[-1]
        else:
            return list_to_check[-2]

    def look_for_anchor_indexes_in_split_lines(self):
        &#34;&#34;&#34; looks for anchor indices in the split lines. Adds them to the relevant list. 3 types of anchors.

        first filters out empty lines.

        If a line has something in it, checks to see if the first index is &#39;SAMPLE&#39;.

        If it is, adds the index of the line to sample_list_indexes. These indexes are used to parse
        horizontal data tables.

        Then checks if the first index is &#39;Samples:&#39;. If it is, adds the index to backup_sample_list_indexes.

        These indexes are used to parse sample metadata from the header part of the report (name, date, location, etc).
        This information is generally taken from horizontal data tables, and then the ICP data tables piggyback.
        If there are no horizontal data tables, or if there are samples in vertical data tables that aren&#39;t present
        in horizontal data tables, we need a second way to get sample metadata. That&#39;s what the backup is for.

        Finally checks if the first index is &#39;ELEMENTS&#39;.

        If it is, adds the index to analyte_list_indexes. These indexes are used to parse vertical ICP style
        data tables. &#34;&#34;&#34;

        for item in self.mb_file_split_lines:
            if len(item) &gt; 0:
                if item[0] == &#39;SAMPLE&#39;:
                    self.sample_list_indexes.append(self.mb_file_split_lines.index(item))
                elif item[0] == &#39;Samples:&#39;:
                    self.backup_sample_list_indexes.append(self.mb_file_split_lines.index(item))
                elif item[0] == &#39;ELEMENTS&#39;:
                    self.analyte_list_indexes.append(self.mb_file_split_lines.index(item))
                else:
                    pass

    def pre_generate_backup_samples_dictionary_entries(self):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;generates backup samples dictionary metadata entries, so that ICP formatted data can be properly assigned.

        there may be many indexes, we only need one as all the sample lists should be the same. Will have to deal with
        this if this is not the case in the future (09June21).

        empty_list is used to determine when we&#39;ve come to a gap in the page, which means we are no longer reading in
        our sample information.

        Once a gap is hit, it&#39;s assumed that we&#39;ve reached the end of the header. We then collapse all the lists of
        lines into one long list. We iterate through this list.

        The first time we hit a parenthesis &#39;)&#39;, we know were at the start of a sample. Once we hit another parenthesis,
        we know we are at the start of the next sample.

        This logic is used to split the information up into segments where the last three items will be location code,
        date, and time, the first item will be the sample number, and the remaining indexes when combined in order
        are the sample name. &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # once we hit a gap in the file, empty_list will be set to true, and we will know we are at the end of the
        # sample information.

        sort of a controller function, mostly calls other functions in the correct order. Each sample index represents
        a data table that needs to be &#39;harvested&#39;. for data table, the analyte names, units, and values are isolated,

        iterates through samples. First checks to see if sample is a blank, and if so, handles accordingly (no date
        or time).

        If the sample is not a blank, we find the index the sample values start at/ the name information
        ends at. This is equal to the length of the samples list - the length of the analyte_information list (because
        there will be one analyte identifier per value). Uses this to slice off the sample name, location code,
        date, time, and isolate them. If no sampling location is detected, then &#39;no location&#39; is inserted instead
        (without a sampling location, we can&#39;t upload to WaterTrax, so this would be a fatal error).

        data tables in the file.

        Checks to see if there are any backup sample indices to work on - sometimes, when there is only
        horizontal data in the report, the admin staff don&#39;t add in the samples line.

        Each sublist corresponds to a sample. The first two characters of the first item in the sublist

         Analyte rows are read up to a pre-determined amount (total_amount_of_analytes).

         For each sample in the table, a key is made in metal_triplets_dictionary. We then go through the analyte rows

    def get_client_name_and_jobnumber(self):

        Jobnumber is also passed to class as a parameter
        (forgot, wrote this unnecessary bit of code, too lazy to delete). &#34;&#34;&#34;

    def get_job_number_from_first_line(self, list_to_check):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;finds the job number in the first line.

        checks to see if there is a &#39;pg X&#39; after the job number. Checks by seeing if the length of the last element is
        7. If it is, it&#39;s assumed to be the job number. If it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s assumed to be the &#39;pg X&#39; designator, and it
        is also assumed that the list element before it is the job number.

        Parameters
        ----------
        list_to_check : list
            the list to check - the first line of the file, split by space, in list form.

        Returns
        -------
        list_to_check[n] : string
            where n = -1 or -2. The item at index n will be the jobnumber in string form. &#34;&#34;&#34;

        if len(list_to_check[-1]) == 7:
            return list_to_check[-1]
        else:
            return list_to_check[-2]

    def look_for_anchor_indexes_in_split_lines(self):
        &#34;&#34;&#34; looks for anchor indices in the split lines. Adds them to the relevant list. 3 types of anchors.

        first filters out empty lines.

        If a line has something in it, checks to see if the first index is &#39;SAMPLE&#39;.

        If it is, adds the index of the line to sample_list_indexes. These indexes are used to parse
        horizontal data tables.

        Then checks if the first index is &#39;Samples:&#39;. If it is, adds the index to backup_sample_list_indexes.

        These indexes are used to parse sample metadata from the header part of the report (name, date, location, etc).
        This information is generally taken from horizontal data tables, and then the ICP data tables piggyback.
        If there are no horizontal data tables, or if there are samples in vertical data tables that aren&#39;t present
        in horizontal data tables, we need a second way to get sample metadata. That&#39;s what the backup is for.

        Finally checks if the first index is &#39;ELEMENTS&#39;.

        there may be many indexes, we only need one as all the sample lists should be the same. Will have to deal with
        this if this is not the case in the future (09June21).

        empty_list is used to determine when we&#39;ve come to a gap in the page, which means we are no longer reading in
        our sample information.

        Once a gap is hit, it&#39;s assumed that we&#39;ve reached the end of the header. We then collapse all the lists of
        lines into one long list. We iterate through this list.

        The first time we hit a parenthesis &#39;)&#39;, we know were at the start of a sample. Once we hit another parenthesis,
        we know we are at the start of the next sample.

        This logic is used to split the information up into segments where the last three items will be location code,
        date, and time, the first item will be the sample number, and the remaining indexes when combined in order
        are the sample name. &#34;&#34;&#34;

        iterates through samples. First checks to see if sample is a blank, and if so, handles accordingly (no date
        or time).

        If the sample is not a blank, we find the index the sample values start at/ the name information
        ends at. This is equal to the length of the samples list - the length of the analyte_information list (because
        there will be one analyte identifier per value). Uses this to slice off the sample name, location code,
        date, time, and isolate them. If no sampling location is detected, then &#39;no location&#39; is inserted instead
        (without a sampling location, we can&#39;t upload to WaterTrax, so this would be a fatal error).

        Checks to see if there are any backup sample indices to work on - sometimes, when there is only

         Analyte rows are read up to a pre-determined amount (total_amount_of_analytes).
